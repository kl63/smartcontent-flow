      This is a placeholder for the audio file that would be generated by a text-to-speech API.
      The text that would be converted to speech is:
      
      "Excited to share insights on the latest trends in the industry at jh. Our team is dedicated to delivering top-notch solutions that drive business growth and success.

      To implement actual TTS, you would need to:
      1. Install a TTS library (e.g., say.js, Google Cloud TTS, Amazon Polly)
      2. Replace this placeholder with actual audio generation code
      3. Use the audio file in your video generation
